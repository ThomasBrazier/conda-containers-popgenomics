# Distruct 1.1

Release [1.1](https://web.stanford.edu/group/rosenberglab/distruct.html).

This docker is compatible with Biocontainers guidelines and practices, though with minor adjustements. The working directory is `/data`. The user is `biodocker`.

## Usage

`distruct` is a standalone program which has to be in the same directory, hence instead of being in `home/biodocker/bin` the application is in the working directory `/data`.

You just need to bind your host working directory to the `/data` directory in the docker.

Call `distruct` with `./distruct`.
